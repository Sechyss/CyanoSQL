# CyanoSQL
CyanoSQL is a list of Scripts that I used during my PhD to analyse different genomes
from marine cyanobacteria to try to elucidate the function of hypothetical genes
by combining bioinformatics and other computational biology tools.

For the material and scripts related to the paper "A distinct, high affinity, alkaline phosphatase facilitates occupation 
of P-depleted environments by marine picocyanobacteria" check the Psip1Paper_SuppFiles directory where scripts are located
and the goals of each analysis are specified.
